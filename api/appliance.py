    # This provides a value for L removed per kWh under specified test conditions.
    # Test temperature is 73 F (+/- 2 F) with 60% (+/- 5%) relative humidity
    # (averages must be 73 F +/- 0.5 F with 60% +/- 2% humidity)
    # The test must also be performed for 2 hours for the calculation of IEF.
    # The power is based off of both the 2 hour test and "low power mode" (both in hourly rates)
    # We can look up the maximum capacity of the user's existing dehumidifier and calculate an old and new kWh based on that. This is just a simple equation based on the user's info and best guess at tank switches per day.
    # When we compare this, we can use a different dehumidifier and use the user's old water removal capacity and tank switches to calculate a new energy requirement.
    # The result is energy consumed per year
    # The "most efficient" criteria is defined by this IEF and also by the size and type of dehumidifier
